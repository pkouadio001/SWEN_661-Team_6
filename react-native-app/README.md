# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

🧪 Running Tests – CareConnect

This project uses Jest and @testing-library/react-native (RNTL) for unit and component testing.

📦 1. Install Dependencies

Before running tests, make sure all dependencies are installed:

npm install

or if using yarn:

yarn install
▶️ 2. Run All Tests

To run all tests once:

npm test

or:

npx jest
🔁 3. Run Tests in Watch Mode (Recommended During Development)
npm test -- --watch

Jest will re-run tests automatically when files change.

📊 4. Generate Test Coverage Report

To see test coverage:

npm test -- --coverage

After running, Jest will generate a coverage summary in the terminal and create a /coverage folder.

To open the HTML report:

open coverage/lcov-report/index.html # macOS
start coverage/lcov-report/index.html # Windows
🧪 5. Run a Specific Test File

To run a single test file:

npx jest app/_tests_/tasks-context.test.tsx

You can also run by test name:

npx jest -t "adds a new task"
🧱 Test Structure

Test files are located in:

app/_tests_/

Test files follow this naming convention:

\*.test.tsx

Example:

tasks-context.test.tsx
health-logs-context.test.tsx
theme-context.test.tsx
⚙️ Test Setup

The project uses:

jest.config.js

jest.setup.ts

The setup file includes:

AsyncStorage mock

React Native mocks

Testing Library configuration

🚨 Common Issues & Fixes
❌ AsyncStorage is null

Make sure AsyncStorage is mocked in jest.setup.ts:

jest.mock(
"@react-native-async-storage/async-storage",
() =>
require("@react-native-async-storage/async-storage/jest/async-storage-mock")
);
❌ Expo bundling error referencing testing-library

Make sure:

@testing-library/react-native is in devDependencies

You are NOT importing testing libraries inside app runtime code

Test files are NOT imported by production files

🧹 Reset Jest Cache (If Needed)

If tests behave strangely:

npx jest --clearCache
📌 Notes

Tests run in a Node environment, not in the Expo runtime.

You do NOT need to run expo start to execute tests.

Testing libraries should never be imported into production app files.
